# tic-tac-toe

## A simple game of tic-tac-toe 

I used to work at a startup where I did a little marketing. This was what I would use. Within a 30-45 minute period I would build as much of the game as possible and introduce new concepts to potential students. 
Generally speaking the students were from underserved and underrepresented communites, I was just trying to give them a taste of what software engineer is.
